## Overview

This study aims to predict whether Manchester City can continue their championship reign in the 2024 Premier League season. By analyzing historical performance data, the Soccer Power Index (SPI), and match-specific probabilities, we apply statistical models to assess the likelihood of their continued success. Our approach combines linear regression and probability analysis to model both the overall chances of winning and the performance metrics of key teams. The results suggest a strong probability that Manchester City will remain at the top of the league, driven by their consistent performance and dominance in key matchups. This research contributes to the growing field of sports analytics by providing data-driven insights into team performance, and it has broader implications for both fans and football clubs aiming to understand and predict championship outcomes.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the auto-complete tool, Codriver. The abstract and introduction were written with the help of ChatHorse and the entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
